# Movie Website dynamically generated using Python

This project uses python to generate a website (html/css/js) dynamically. 

*fresh_tomatoes.py is forked from https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py and some content has been changed in my version.

# Run

- Run the "entertainment_center.py" by entering "python entertainment_center.py" in the terminal
- If you're on windows and using git bash, use "winpty python entertainment_center.py"
